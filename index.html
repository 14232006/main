         Hello , my magical partner, What you're about to see next is a little <br>
         something I made in an effort to show you how magical every moment I <br>
         spend with you is. Hold my hand so that I can show you what it is!! 
         <a href = "https://14232006.github.io/magic/">Follow me</a> <br>
         <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="countdown" id="text1">
        <br>
        I hope you enjoyed that!!  Now , lets be honest here. You babie, <br>
        are fucking âœ¨âœ¨ARTâœ¨âœ¨. And that is the truest thing in the whole<br>
        world. And art, doesn't belong just anywhere. Art belongs in beautiful <br>
        museums, art galleries. It's meant to be worshipped, looked upon and <br>
        be praised. I hope you remember a stylist af website (camille mormal) <br>
        that I showed you sometime ago. Guess what, I managed to make it into <br>
        a little art gallery for my favourtie piece of art in the entire world, <a href = " https://14232006.github.io/scroller/">YOU.</a><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      
      <div class="countdown" id="text1">
        That camille mormal thing took so much effort ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. I hope you loved it yaar. <br>
        I love you so much. Next up, I MADE A COLLAGE OF MY SOME OF FAV PICS TUMHARA!! <br>
        But obviously, I tried taking it up a level by using the power of code lul. I hope <br>
        you like it, you can play around with it a lot if you want to okay?
        <a href = "https://14232006.github.io/collage/"> COME SEE IT HEHE </a ><br>
